# Subgroup Analysis Under Cure Rate Model
In survival analysis studies, cure rate model is widely used when a cure fraction exists. It is quite often to use a common factor for people in the same group. In practice, it is  possible that the affect could be different within group. For the reason, subgroup detection has become popular recently in clinical trials. In this project, we will propose a cure rate model, which assuming there are two subgroups in the same group.
